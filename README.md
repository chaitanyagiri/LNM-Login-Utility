# LNM-Login-Utility

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaitanyagiri/LNM-Login-Utility/master/logo.png)
<br>A chrome extension to ease off the login functionality of the LNMIIT current login portal.
## What does it do?
In the current login portal of LNMIIT you have to login after every 4 hours to use Internet so you can not download large files so this simply bypasses all the required formalities for you and logs you in after every 3 hours so you are logged in for almost 24 hours/day.

## Is it safe to use?
Definately! its just a bot doing things for you nothing fancy. A person with very little knowledge of java script can tell you that <b>not a single piece of information is going anywhere</b>.

## How to install it?
1, Download zip folder(from github link given) and extract it.

2, Go to the extracted folder and edit the 'myscript.js' file by adding your username and password in the space provided.

3, Open google chrome/Chromium->'more tools'->'Extentions'
	-turn on 'develpers mode'
	-click on 'Load Unpacked Extentions'
	-navigate to the extracted folder and select the extracted 		 folder.

4, Open the Login portal of LNMIIT and click on the extension icon on top right corner. BOOM YOU ARE LOGGED IN NOW.
			
       FROM NOW YOU WILL BE LOGGED IN AFTER EVERY 3 HOURS.

NOTE-If you face any issues please create an issue in github repository itself and feel free to mark a star to the repository to show the support.
